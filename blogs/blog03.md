## Research : Bias && Ethics

### Key Concepts && Activity Glossary

- Quality - research evidence that is robust, verifiable, ethical, and maintains integrity when examined.
- Bias - preferences that inhibit impartial judgement.
- Ethics / Ethical Standards - modern system of principles and rules that define moral obligations towards the rights of participants and any others involved or affected by the research.
- Consent - the agreement of participants (consent should be approached after the participant is fully aware of what they will be contributing to, how they will contribute, and how / where their information will be stored)
- Reliability - an attribute of research quality; how consistently a method measures something and returns a consistent result.
- Validity - an attribute of research quality; how accurately a method measures something. High reliability is a good indicator that a method / measurement is valid.
- Systematic Errors - a type of error where the results consistently deviate by a similar or fixed amount from the actual result of the measurement.
- Privacy - an important aspect to the development of any research involving human participants.

### Summary

The class topic for this week revolved around the concepts of ethics and bias in our upcoming research. These are crucial and fundamental aspects of good research that need to be understood before research can be properly designed or begun. 

I think bias is important because it addresses any preferences that the researcher / researchers may have when approaching their research. Such preferences could skew the integrity of the research before it even begins.

Ethics is more concerned with all the participants of the research, from the authors of cited resources to individuals that provide data through interviews or surveys. a focus on ethics ensures that everyone involved is respected and treated responsibly, equally, and equitably.
