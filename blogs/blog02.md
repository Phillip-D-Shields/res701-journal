## Research : Sources && Evidence

### Primary vs Secondary Research

> 游붛 Primary research requires the researcher to participate in the data-gathering process. The researcher does not depend on already existing data, instead collects first-hand information for the investigation. 

> 游붛 Secondary research is a research approach where the researcher relies on existing materials instead of gathering data directly. This approach is less expensive and more time-efficient than primary.

> For this class, i will rely mostly on secondary research, opting for primary research when/if possible. 


### Qualitative vs Quantatative 

> Qualitative Research : words : [游꼴 survey, interview, notes, reading, polls ...游꼴] 
 
> Quantitative Research : numbers : [游꼴 stats, units, prices, proportions, rates of change, ratios ...游꼴]

> For this class, I will use a varied combination of qualitative and quantatative research.   

### Top 5 Research Databases

> 游꺐 After performing multiple keyword searches regarding my intended research topic, ProQuest by far had the most results. The other four databases each had a few results, usually loosely related to my query terms.

> 游꺐 Going forward, Proquest will be my primary research database, Masterfile Complete and General Onefile will be used as secondary resources.
