#### Steps for Developing a Research Question

The steps for developing a research question, listed below, can help you organize your thoughts.

- Step 1: Pick a topic (or consider the one assigned to you).

- Step 2: Write a narrower/smaller topic that is related to the first.

- Step 3: List some potential questions that could logically be asked in relation to the narrow topic.

- Step 4: Pick the question that you are most interested in.

- Step 5: Change that question youâ€™re interested in so that it is more focused.


### 5 characteristics of a good research question

1: specific: it is important not to leave aspects of the question too vague.

2: researchable: there has to be data and info related to your topic that is actually obtainable.

3: interesting: interest in the topic will help motivate the researcher to complete thorough research.

4: relevant: a research question should be related to the field of study of the researcher.

5: complexity: a research question should not be too simple, nor too complex.
