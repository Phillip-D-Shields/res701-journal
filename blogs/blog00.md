## Intro Class

### What do I think research is?

Research is the collection of information to reach some type of conclusion. There are numerous scenarios where research could mean different things. For this blog, I will consider the type of research specific to the starting phases of my final project.

### What will I need research skills for?

Research skills, in general, are a good skill set to have. For this project, research skills will focus on gathering and processing information from various credible sources. I will need to know how to create semantic queries and where to query. I will then need to know how to record and document significant and useful findings, then lastly I will need to know how to present my research. There are many skills needed within each of the before mentioned examples, but this is a broad-stroke type of response. 

### What is a research journal and for whom is it written?

A research journal is a collection of articles, written by experts in a specific area of a topic. The articles are written and often peer-reviewed or shared with other experts or students within the same area of specialty.

### What is plagiarism? And why should it be avoided?

Plagiarism is the act of copying another's work and presenting it as my own. It is a type of literary theft. There are several good reasons not to plagiarise, but the most obvious to me is that it diminishes the integrity of research and empiricism in general.

### What are some areas I would like to research?

I would like to research blockchain technology more, with an emphasis on the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Cardano Network. I have already started some personal research into both of those topics, and am hoping that I will be able to gather a much better understanding of both, especially Cardano, through my project.
