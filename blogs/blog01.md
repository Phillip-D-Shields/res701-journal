## Ontology and the concept of Truth

### What is truth?

Truth seems to be fairly open to inerpretation, but generally speaking, truth is an agreed upon concept within a group of people. There are some large truths, such as gravity for example. Gravity is observable and nearly universally agreed upon. We understand gravity within the context of our current existence. There might be more to gravity that we can't yet comprehend, empericism can be used to further understand the truth of gravity. There are also small truths, usually concepts held by a small group of people to be true. Often these small truths are divisive.

### What is Ontology? Epistemology?

Ontology is the philosophical endeavour to understand and explain the concept of reality. Epistemology is the study of knowledge, specifically to its limits and validity. Ontological beliefs relate to what reality a person believes to be true. Epistemological beliefs relate to how a person could study and validate their ontological beliefs. A paradigm is a grouping of ontological and epistemological beliefs used together.

Personally, the paradigm `Critical Realism` makes the most sense to me.

His conclusion is that time is much better spent enjoying eachother and the gift of life. 

> Truth changes as men change, and when truth becomes stable men will become dead, and the insect and the fire and the flood will become truth. ~Bukowski
