## Academic articles and credibility

during one of the activities we had to look over aspects of an academic paper to help us understand what considerations should be made when choosing articles or papers within our research.

### credibility of sources discussion

1. Textbooks: Textbooks ideally should be a ten, they should be some of the most credible sources for info in our societies. But the truth of textbooks, especially in America, is that they are written by the victors. Often times this means that information is skewed, neglected, and / or infatuated to support those currently in power.

2. Friends & Family: I come from a place in the states often referred to as "The Bible Belt". A lot of my friends are liberal, and most of my family is conservative. I have been out of the states about 20 years now, and over that time I have watched and listened to both friends and family become extremely polarized and partisan.

3. Academic Journals: Most of the time I feel Academic journals are credible, of course, there are exceptions. These days, someone must research the history and reputation of an academic journal to verify it is credible. There is always a chance of corporate, religious, political, or other biased influenced.

I don't think I could properly read the entire paper, as some of the maths discussed and examined are beyond my comprehension.
